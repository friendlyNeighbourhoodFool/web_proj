# web_proj

Created an application which allows users to search for recipe of different meals even if they know only one ingredient from that meal. 
Used an API to fetch and display different food items that match the searched keyword in their ingredients list. 
Used JavaScript, HTML and CSS to display information regarding the meal and provide users with a website link which takes users to an appropriate web page 
regarding the preparation of that meal.
